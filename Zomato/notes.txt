//// Social media login integration

(1) facebook login
(2) google login


Everyone need to create developer accounts:
    - facebook
    - google

    ids ( developer accounts ) : we need to integrate social media logins


Following Steps:

    (1) npmjs.com -> get the required libraries
        -> for facebook
            npm i react-facebook-login --save
        -> for google
            npm i react-google-login --save

    (2) Signup for developer accounts on facebook and google
        -> for facebook
            -> go to https://developers.facebook.com/apps
            -> create an app
            -> get the App Id (XXXXXXXXXXXX)
        -> for google
            -> go to https://console.cloud.google.com/home/dashboard
            -> create a client first (first ask for cinfigure the OAuth consent)
            -> get the client ID and the client secret:
                Client ID: XXXXXXXXXXXXXX.apps.googleusercontent.com
                Client Secret: XXXXXXXXXXXX

    (3) Go to the FE screen and integrate the facebook and google logins



///// Deployments

    -> making the product available over the internet
    -> Layers:
        -> FE (reactJS, HTML, CSS, JS, BS)
        -> BE (NodeJS, ExpressJS)
        -> DB (MongoDB) -> MongoDB Atlas -> cloud based database

    -> cloud based deployments
        -> heroku (https://id.heroku.com/login)
            (1) create a free account
            (2) Types of deployments they support:
                -> GUI Based deployments - we can use the heroku website to do the deployments
                -> CLI Based deployments - we do the depoyments using the command prompt / terminal

        -> Deployments will be done in 2 phases:

            (1) BE Deployment:
                - we will do it using the CLI
                - steps of the CLI deployments:
                    Step1: Install the heroku package from npm, globally
                        > npm i -g heroku
                    Step2: change some configurations in app.js and create a new ENV file (Procfile)
                    Step3: push the code to heorku and in the CLI and trigger the build
                        -> heroku login in CLI
                            > heorku login
                                (follow the login process)
                        -> git add .
                            (if not a git repository, then first do a git init)
                        -> git commit -m "commit message"
                        -> heroku create zomato-b22-be
                            (this will create a new application in heorku)
                        -> git push heroku master
                            (this will deploy the application)
                - BE is built and deployed

            (2) FE Deployment:
                - we will do using the GUI
                - in the FE, update the BE URL with the deployed address
                - steps for the GUI Deployment:
                    Step1: need to host the FE code in Github
                    Step2: create a new app from the heroku dashboard
                    Step3: need to connect the heroku app with the github account where we have pushed the FE code
                    Step4: choose the branch and trigger the build
                    Step5: access your application and verify
